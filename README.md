# In React, "state" refers to the internal data of a component that can change over time and can affect how the component renders. State allows you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Stateful components manage their own state, while stateless components (functional components) receive data as props and don't manage state themselves.

# A state can be modified based on user action or network changes
# Every time the state of an object changes, React re-renders the component to the browser
# The state object is initialized in the constructor
# The state object can store multiple properties
# this.setState() is used to change the value of the state object
# setState() function performs a shallow merge between the new and the previous state
